# StockWH Project

## Project Description

**StockWH** is a data warehouse project aimed at collecting, processing, and analyzing stock data from listed companies in Vietnam (e.g., HPG, FPT, LPB). The project uses Airflow to manage the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and dbt to transform raw data into dimension and fact tables, enabling comprehensive financial and stock price analyses.
